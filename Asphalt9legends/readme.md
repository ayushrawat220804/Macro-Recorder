Ever since I started playing Asphalt 9 Legends, engaging in numerous car hunt events, multiplayer races, and various challenges, I've noticed a recent shift towards a more pay-to-win model in the game. This makes it increasingly challenging for free-to-play enthusiasts like myself to excel in car hunts and secure multiplayer rewards.

In response, I've created a GitHub repository specifically for players enjoying Asphalt 9 Legends on PC, whether it's the Microsoft Windows Store version or the Steam version. Within this repository, you'll find meticulously crafted macros designed to automate races, saving valuable time for players.

To make use of these macros, ensure you meet a few prerequisites: Firstly, have the Asphalt 9 Legends Microsoft Windows Store version or the Steam version installed on your PC or laptop. Secondly, install a macro recorder; I recommend using this link: Macro Recorder https://www.macrorecorder.com/download/.

Lastly, rest assured that my macro scripts are entirely safe, with no associated risks.

Alternatively, players can customize their own Asphalt 9 macros by leveraging and adapting the scripts I've created in the repository. This initiative aims to enhance the gaming experience for all, offering a helping hand to those navigating the evolving landscape of Asphalt 9 Legends.
